			<h1>Partnerships </h1>
			I have been approached by several people who are interested in partnering with FakeMoneyRealStocks.com, and I 
            figured I'd address the most common questions here. Please <a href="/contactus.php">contact me</a> with
            additional questions and ideas; odds are we can work something out.<br><br>
            <strong>Who are you?</strong><br>
            My name is <a href="http://www.samsanders.net">Sam Sanders</a>. I'm a free-lance web designer in South Carolina.
            Yes, South Carolina.<br><br>
            <strong>What are you looking for?</strong><br>
            I'm open to any sort of partnerships, but I'm focusing on creating a widget which could be placed on any
            web site which would allow that site's users to play my stock charting game directly on their pages. I would distribute
            this for a flat monthly rate or some type of revenue sharing.<br><br>
            <strong>Why would I pay to have this on my site?</strong>
            One word: stickiness. Since its release in mid-March, my users have made over <u>one million</u> "trades" on Inspectd.com.
            I've accumulated over 900 registered users in the first three weeks, who have averaged 77 trades apiece. That's a lot of
            time spent on the site. Those eyeballs could translate into money in your pocket.<br><br>
			<strong>Anything else?</strong><br>
            I'm talking with a data provider now who would help me offer more advanced features, such as Bollinger bands and stochastics,
            as well as historical options charting in the future. I can't tell you how many emails I've gotten that used the word
            "addictive" to describe Inspectd.com, and I think my white label widget would be a great match to plugin 
            to any existing financial site.<br><br>
            <strong>What next?</strong>
            <a href="/contactus.php">Contact me</a>. I think we can help each other out.
